# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

### 🧠 About the Project
This is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** developed in **C++**, designed for **two players**.  
The game runs entirely inside the terminal and allows players to take turns marking positions on a 3×3 grid using `'X'` and `'O'`.  
It checks for valid moves, detects wins, and declares a draw automatically — all implemented within a single `main()` function for simplicity.
